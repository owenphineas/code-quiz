# Code Quiz
## Description
This is a seven-question timed quiz about coding. When a question is answered correctly, points are added to the score. When a question is answered incorrectly, no points are awarded and 10 seconds are taken off the timer. The quiz ends when all the questions have been answered or time runs out. The final score is calculated by the points awarded from correct answers plus the number of remaining seconds. At the end of the quiz, the user can enter their initials to save their high score, which is stored in localstorage. The high score screen displays the top ten high scores in order of highest to lowest.
